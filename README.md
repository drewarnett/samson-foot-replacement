# Samson foot replacement

Had a Samson tripod missing one of the original injection molded hard rubber
feet.

## Design

Took some measurements and assumed original was designed to fractional
imperial.

Leg:
* inside diameter:  1 9/32"
* outside diameter:  1 3/8"
* vent hole (two places) diameter:  9/32"
* vent hole center to leg end:  23/64"

Foot:
* insertion depth (approx):  1/2"
* diameter:  1 3/8" or a hair less
* unradiused foot length:  3/32"

Estimated:
* foot insertion outside diameter:  1 1/4"
* foot shoulder width:  3/64" or a hair less
* foot radius:  1"

Designed cutout for air vent:
* slot depth:  1/2"
* slot width:  9/32"
* slot botton radius:  9/64"

## Fabrication

Should be easy part to turn on a lathe.

For 3D printing, used FreeCAD to solid model:
* draw revolved profile
* draw cutout profile
* added fillet 0.3 mm radius inside shoulder to help 3D print overhang
  transition
* exported .stl (3D mesh)
* sliced (generated CAM)
* printed on Prusa Mk 4 with Overture TPU filament

There are many printing services if one does not have a printer.

## Installation

Scraped out the bulk of the original contact cement residue.

Used shoe goop per instructions.  Applied to inside of leg (two places) and to
insert of foot (two places).  Waited proscribed time.  Inserted foot with
care to keep air vent slot aligned with air vent holes. Allowed to cure.

## Comments

Field trials started to evaluate durability and tolerance to heat.

Feedback welcome.
